# ABM_CPMII

tu możemy pisać plany, papery itp.

<https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-mesa-agent-based-modeling-in-python-bcb0596e1c9a>

nice

Pomysły na to co będziemy modelować: - religia, np. Izrael i jak zmienia
się religia wyznawana z wiekiem, pod wpływem rodziny, znajomych,
sąsiadów etc etc - blockchain - spread of information on the internet -
this has been done but is kind of interesting in terms of information
spread

### Z myślą o napisaniu raportu zrobię tu notatki:

Agent-based modeling (z wikipedii na easy, wstępne rozeznanie):

-   computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of
    autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as
    organizations or groups) in order to understand the behavior of a
    system and what governs its outcomes

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   explanatory insight \> solving specific engineering problems

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-    individual agents are boundedly (bounded by what they know and
    their own interests) rational - acting in own interests, they might
    be able to learn

-   We live in a very complex world where we face complex phenomena such
    as the formation of social norms and emergence of new disruptive
    technologies. To better understand such phenomena, social scientists
    often use a reductionism approach where they reduce complex systems
    to lower-level variables and model the relationships among them
    through a scheme of equations such as partial differential equations
    (PDE). This approach that is called equation-based modeling (EBM)
    has some basic weaknesses in modeling real complex systems. *EBMs
    emphasize nonrealistic assumptions, such as unbounded rationality
    and perfect information, while adaptability, evolvability, and
    network effects go unaddressed* (LOOK INTO - could be a nice idea to
    take something that has been modeled with these partial differential
    equations and propose an ABM model for it? perhaps?)

Social network analysis: SOCIOGRAMS

-   social structures commonly visualized through social network
    analysis: social media networks, meme spread, information
    circulation, friendship and acquaintance networks, peer learner
    networks, business networks, knowledge networks, difficult working
    relationships, collaboration, kinship, sexual contacts, disease
    transmission
